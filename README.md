# README

Knit Wits is a Rails application that allows users to browse local Colorado handmade knits, add items to their cart, checkout, and view their orders. It also allows an administrator to view a variety of analytics about their users, items, and orders. It was built by Turing students Max Stackhouse, Katy Welyzcko, and Zachary Landes.

Below are the user stories that were used to guide our development

## Basic Application Setup
### In Terminal:
* `git clone https://github.com/katyjane8/knit-wits.git`
* `cd knit-wits`.
* `bundle install`
* `rails db:create` to create database
* `rails db:migrate` to migrate database
* `rails db:seed` to seed database with default data
* `rails server`
* open in browser: "http://localhost:3000/"


## Seed File
Create new Dataset with:
`ruby db/seed_runner.rb`

or specify number of users, orders and line items:
`ruby db/seed_runner.rb #_of_users #_of_orders #_of_line_items`

After new dataset is created run:
`rails db:reset`

The seed_runner.rb file controls the number of users, orders and order_items. It utilizes the faker gem to create dummy data. To generate a new dataset of users, orders and order_items you need to run `ruby db/seed_runner.rb` from the root directory. The script can also be run to generate a dataset with a specified set of values `ruby db/seed_runner.rb #_of_users #_of_orders #_of_line_items`.

items.csv and categories.csv were items added to the webapp manually, then exported into a csv. The images for products are connected to images in assets/images/products. There are no generators for items, the need to be added through the web app.
